A demo web app showcasing Compose Network's synchronous composability across Ethereum rollups. This demo enables atomic transactions between different blockchain networks through Compose's Shared Publisher coordination layer.

## What is Compose Network?

Compose Network unites Ethereum rollups to enable instant and composable transactions, where actions across rollups can happen together in a single atomic flow. It's powered by a Shared Publisher, a coordination layer that allows rollups to execute operations synchronously while each maintains its own sequencing and independence.

## Features

### Bridge Functionality
- **Cross-chain ETH bridging** from Hoodi testnet to Rollup A or Rollup B

### Swap Functionality  
- **Token swaps** between SSV, ETH, and USDC
- **Cross-rollup swaps** (Rollup A â†” Rollup B)
- **Same-rollup swaps** within Rollup A or Rollup B

### Key Capabilities
- **Synchronous composability** - transactions either succeed together or revert together
- **Smart account integration** using Kernel accounts and ECDSA validators

## How It Works

This demo implements the core Compose Network transaction flow:

### End-to-End Transaction Flow
1. **Account Setup**: Creates Kernel accounts and ECDSA validators on source and destination chains
2. **Allowance Management**: Verifies and sets ERC-20 allowances to bridge contracts
3. **UserOperation Preparation**: Builds and signs UserOperations for both chains using `compose_buildSignedUserOpsTx`
4. **Cross-chain Settlement**: Submits all of the transactions together using `eth_sendXTransaction` and returns the transaction hashes

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Blockchain Integration**: Wagmi + Viem for Ethereum interactions
- **Smart Accounts**: ZeroDev Kernel accounts with ECDSA validation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
